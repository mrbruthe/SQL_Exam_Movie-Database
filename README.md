# 🎬 SQL Exams – TMDb Movie Database Analysis
Welcome to my SQL exam project, built around The Movie Database (TMDb)! This repository showcases my ability to write and execute SQL queries to explore and analyze a rich dataset of movies, actors, production companies, and more.

## 📘 About the Project
This project was part of the ALX SQL Exam, designed to test my proficiency in SQL through a series of multiple-choice questions and query challenges. The exam was conducted using Amazon Athena, and all queries were executed within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## 🗃️ Dataset Overview
The TMDb database contains detailed information about:

🎥 Movies: titles, release dates, budgets, revenues, ratings

👥 Actors: names and roles across various films

🏆 Oscars: award categories and nominations

🏢 Production companies and countries

🎭 Genres, languages, and keywords

The database schema is relational and includes tables such as movies, actors, cast, oscars, genres, and mapping tables like genremap, keywordmap, and productioncompanymap.

## 📂 Repository Contents

File	Description

SQL_Exam.ipynb	Jupyter Notebook containing all SQL queries and answers to exam questions
TMDB.db	SQLite database file used for querying
README.md	This documentation file

## 🧠 What I Learned
Writing efficient SQL queries using JOIN, GROUP BY, COUNT, DISTINCT, and filtering techniques

Understanding relational database design and entity relationships

Analyzing real-world data from the film industry

Using Athena and Jupyter for interactive SQL execution

## 🚀 How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/mrbruthe/SQL_Exams_Movie-Database.git
Open SQL_Exam.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run each cell to execute the SQL queries against the TMDb database.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments
Special thanks to ALX Africa for the opportunity to work on this exam and to TMDb for providing such a rich dataset for exploration.
